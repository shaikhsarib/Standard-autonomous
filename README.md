# Standard Autonomous (v2.5)

A production-grade, multi-agent Intelligence Center, Technical Audit, and Autonomous Sales Development Representative (SDR) platform inspired by **Paperclip** (multi-agent workforce management) and **REA** (Reverse-Engineering Anything / Chrome DevTools).

---

## ⚡ Key Capabilities & Autonomous Workforce

### 🤖 1. Specialized Agent Org Chart (Paperclip-Style)
- **`ScoutAgent`**: Autonomous lead discovery across Google Maps and Web search. Extracts verified phone numbers (+91 / E.164), sanitizes business names, and filters duplicates.
- **`AuditorAgent` (REA-Inspired)**: Deep technical & mobile site audits. Inspects TTFB response time, SSL certificates, smartphone viewport responsiveness (iPhone 14 390x844), missing WhatsApp direct ordering widgets (`wa.me`), and missing 1-click booking systems. Captures headless mobile snapshots via Playwright.
- **`CopywriterAgent`**: Synthesizes real audited flaws and quantified revenue loss into persuasive, conversion-focused WhatsApp (Hinglish/English) and consultative cold emails.
- **`ApprovalGate` (Human-in-the-Loop)**: Staging queue in the dashboard. Prevents cold-call spamming: managers can review, edit pitch copy, or 1-click approve for WhatsApp/Email dispatch.
- **`CloserAgent` (Inbound SDR)**: Evaluates incoming prospect replies, classifies intent (pricing objections, competitor agency objections, demo requests, unsubscribe), counters with audit proof, and drives prospects to book a meeting (Calendly).

### 🎯 2. Specialized Vertical Playbooks
- **Freight & Logistics**: Spotlights missing track-and-trace widgets, load booking friction, and slow RFQ turnaround.
- **Event Venues & Planners**: Audits mobile date availability checkers, virtual tours, and 1-click WhatsApp quote requests.
- **Local High-Ticket SMBs**: Focuses on mobile loading speed, click-to-call buttons, and local search visibility.
